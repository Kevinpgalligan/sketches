## Current behaviour
Investigating how the state of a Sketch / the SDL2 window gets updated when we recompile the defsketch form.

#### update-instance-for-redefined-class
Gets called once if slots are not changed, twice if changed. The second time, which is triggered by the defsketch macro calling make-instances-obsolete, it's called without the new slots.

Here's the trace:

WARNING: redefining PREPARE (#<STANDARD-CLASS SKETCH::BLAH>) in DEFMETHOD
  0: (UPDATE-INSTANCE-FOR-REDEFINED-CLASS #<SKETCH::BLAH {100613FDE3}>
                                          (SKETCH::SOMETHING) NIL NIL)
  0: UPDATE-INSTANCE-FOR-REDEFINED-CLASS returned #<SKETCH::BLAH {100613FDE3}>
WARNING: redefining DRAW (#<STANDARD-CLASS SKETCH::BLAH>) in DEFMETHOD

                                          NIL)
  0: UPDATE-INSTANCE-FOR-REDEFINED-CLASS returned #<SKETCH::BLAH {100613FDE3}

After updating from this...

(defsketch blah
            ()
          (background +blue+))

...to this...

(defsketch blah
            ((something 1))
          (background +green+))

Changing the default value of a slot does not count as adding or removing a slot, and is not detected.

Useful to know: the property-list arg to update-instace-for-... contains the values of removed slots, 'cause you can no longer access them using class methods.

#### initialize-instance
This isn't getting called anywhere.
My first thought was wrong, I don't think the window is getting recreated.
But we're calling `prepare` and setting `%setup-called` to false.

#### shared-initialize
Gets called on new class definition (NOT instances of the class).

                        SB-PCL::SAFE-P NIL :DIRECT-DEFAULT-INITARGS NIL)

Also gets called for each defmethod produced by defsketch, apparently.
