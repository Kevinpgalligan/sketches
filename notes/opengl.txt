(Explanations from Gleefre)

Well, it is not too bad, and it works more or less fine.
background is just a direct call to GL IIRC, like glClear or something
Other primitives all are just pushing triangles with different primitives, like :triangle-fan or :triangle-strip
Then push-vertices does the job
There are three "modes": :gpu, which writes the vertices to a buffer and then calls glDrawArrays
:figure, that writes vertices to a CL vector, and then later when figure is rendered it is copied to a gl's buffer and glDrawArray is called
nil, IIUC, just doesn't draw anything
This gl's buffer -- is just a buffer, VBO -- is configured via sketch's vao (which is defined once in the beginning of drawing.lisp)
It is used as a streaming buffer, as described here: http://onrendering.blogspot.com/2011/10/buffer-object-streaming-in-opengl.html
or also here (not sure): https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Buffer_Object_Streaming
So (start-draw) just binds the VBO, VAO; but also it "orphanes" the buffer, that is, it says to OpenGL "please give me a new buffer of the same size"
And (end-draw) just unbinds those
And later kit.sdl2:render :around or :after method calls sdl2:swap-window or something

Which tells OpenGL to swap front & back buffers, that is, to move the scene you drew to the screen
And here is how copy-pixels t works: it assumes that there is one back buffer, which is then copied to the front buffer; and just doesn't clear it with (background ...) in the beginning of rendering
This is why when "swapping buffers" works otherwise it is bugged
From sdl2kit:
(defmethod render :before ((window gl-window))
  (with-slots (gl-context) window
    (sdl2:gl-make-current (sdl-window window) gl-context)))

(defmethod render :after ((window gl-window))
  (when (autowrap:valid-p (sdl-window window))
    (gl:flush)
    (sdl2:gl-swap-window (sdl-window window))))

:before method makes sure that correct gl context is loaded,
:after method makes sure that all drawing commands are finished (gl:flush), and then swaps the window (sdl2:gl-swap-window)

There is also :around method that calls next method in cl-sdl2's main thread, so that all drawing is happening in the same main thread.
(By the way, all event handlers are also run in the main thread, so the main loop looks like this:
-- redraw all windows that have idle-render set to T
-- handle all events
-- repeat)

OpenGL's pipeline is like this:
-- FBO is the destination where drawing commands are rendered, some sort of a "canvas"
-- You can draw a number of triangles in one command, that is, glDrawArrays
  For that you need:
  -- put their coordinates and other attributes (like color) in a buffer -- that is, an array that is stored on GPU
  -- they are then handled by a vertex shader, a program that runs on GPU and can apply vertex transforms for example
    this is where all transforms are handled, mostly -- the current transform matrix is set before the glDrawArrays call, and is used in the shader.
  -- then these triangles are rendered by OpenGL, for each triangle a set of pixels (or fragments) to be drawn is determined
  -- these fragments are passed to the fragment shader, again a program that runs on GPU and it says which color should be used for this pixel
    this is where color is used (which is calculated as "average color of vertices", although it also could be passed to the whole call like with the transform matrix
    this is also how images are drawn: a texture is passed to the whole draw call, and texture coordinates are used to get a color from a picture to be drawn
  -- these pixels / fragments can overlap, so blending is happening, that is, the final color is calculated with respect to transparency according to special rules
    (there are different modes, sketch uses :one-minus-src-alpha or something like tis)
