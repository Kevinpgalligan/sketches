### TODO
* Add alternative defsketch macro that allows passing mixins. This would allow, e.g., a mixin for save functionality or for a GUI with toggleable params.
* Finish Gleefre's double buffering fix.
  -> It's somehow related to double-buffering.
  -> sketch currently turns off double buffering as a hack.
  -> That's not possible w/ Intel graphics?
  -> Better solution to use FBO somehow? (All this according to vyyd).
  -> Gleefre's WIP:
     https://github.com/Gleefre/sketch/tree/gleefre/use-fbos-for-copy-pixels 
* Record sketches.
  > Bindings for a video encoding library.
