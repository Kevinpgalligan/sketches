# How to run
Add soft link to this directory to quicklisp's local-projects folder, then
from the REPL do `(ql:quickload 'sketches)`, then switch to the `sketches` package (`(in-package sketches)`),
then `(make-instance 'name-of-sketch)`.

# Ideas
- Halt & Catch Fire-esque image leaking
- Coloured squares, squares within squares
- Jigsaw effect
- Something with random fields
- Unknown Pleasures album cover
- Snow (a la Celeste)
- Rain (additions: fog, wind, lightning)

# Infrastructure
Eventually, I will probably want to generate a finite number of noise
values up front and map into their range. It's not terribly efficient
to generate the noise values each time the function is called.

# TODO
* Tweak smoothstep interface, it shouldn't do lerp for you.
* Investigate discontinuity in noise (see: 2d noise example, there's a sudden jump between low and high values).
