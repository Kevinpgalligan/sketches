### Sketches
- Halt & Catch Fire-esque image leaking
- Coloured squares, squares within squares
- Jigsaw effect
- Flow fields, layered particle trace.
- Map of underground
- Layers of bezier curves, colour between each layer.
- Colour study.
- Tiling.
- That graph thing in the Singapore museum.
- Fibonacci spiral.
- Artesonado Spanish-style ceiling patterns: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artesonado
- Soft body physics: https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=IxdGyqhppis&pp=ygUMY29kaW5nIHRyYWlu
- Cracked glass.
- White squares on a black grid, each square is mutated (stretched, bent, translated, rotated, whatever).
- Guggenheim stuff.

### TODO
- Encapsulate each sketch in its own package.
- Redesign mountains sketch to avoid using polygon.
- Fix the black spots in the 'growth' sketch, they didn't appear the last time I looked at it.
- Sampling from random distributions (normal, exponential, binomial, poisson)

### Sketch contributions
* Fix the copy-pixels thing.
  - Read up on SDL2, and figure out how CL bindings work.
  - Figure out dynamic between SDL2 and OpenGL.
  - Read sketch code until I understand it.
  - Figure out what double-buffering thing is about.
  - Actually implement it.
* Control flow.
  - Figure out how Processing interface works.
  - Add functions to sketch. (May help to know how sketch interacts with SDL2).
* Record sketches.

  > Use bindings to save sketches.
* Perlin noise.
  - Extract code to a package.
  - Add 'octave' thing.
  - Submit to quicklisp.
  - Incorporate into sketch.
* Bug: empty sketch body gives flashing green screen.
* Canvas features: initialise from an image, get current colour at coordinate.
* [BLOCKED] Fix polygon implementation.
