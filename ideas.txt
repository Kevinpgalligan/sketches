### TODO
- Perlin noise, swap it in to see if it improves any of the sketches.
- Sampling from random distributions (normal, exponential, binomial, poisson)
- Fix the black spots in the 'growth' sketch, they didn't appear the last time I looked at it.
- Redesign mountains sketch to avoid using polygon.

### Sketch contributions
- Export useful symbols (image-width, image-height, canvas-width, canvas-height)
- Canvas features: draw-canvas function, initialise from an image, get current colour at coordinate.
- Save a GIF.
- Perlin noise.
- Fix polygon implementation.
- Bug: empty sketch body gives flashing green screen.
