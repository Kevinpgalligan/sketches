;; First thing needed: perlin noise implementation (in arbitrary dimensions)
;; Possibilities:
;;   Python, https://github.com/caseman/noise
;;   Someone's CL gist, https://gist.github.com/nowl/828707
;;   An older CL library, https://github.com/johnfredcee/black-tie

;; Also: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise
;; Contains references for Perlin Noise papers in case I decide to
;; implement it myself.
